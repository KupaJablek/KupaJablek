### Maximus

I am a vim enjoyer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast currently enrolled at UWO for Computer Science.

I enjoy running role playing games, and programming with Go. 

I'm currently working on:
- A computer science degree at UWO
- A portfolio site using HTMX, Tailwind CSS and Go
- Whatever **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/KupaJablek/)** questions strike my fancy
- **[CheSSH](https://github.com/KupaJablek/CheSSH)** - A secure terminal based chess client to play with your friends
