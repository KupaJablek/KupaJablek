### Maximus

I am a vim enjoyer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast currently enrolled at UWO for Computer Science.

I enjoy running role playing games, and programming with Go. 

I'm currently working on:
- A computer science degree at UWO
- A portfolio site ([maximusslabon.ca](https://maximusslabon.ca)) using HTMX, Tailwind CSS and Go
- Whatever **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/KupaJablek/)** questions strike my fancy
- A role playing campaign using the [Mausritter](https://mausritter.com/) ruleset
