A vim enjoyer and mechanical keyboard enthusiast learning Go and running role playing games.

I'm currently working on:
- **[CheSSH](https://github.com/KupaJablek/CheSSH)** - A secure terminal based chess client to play with your friends
- Last year's **[Advent of Code](https://github.com/KupaJablek/advent_of_code)**
- Whatever **[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/KupaJablek/)** questions strike my fancy

<!--
