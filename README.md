- Honours Specialisation in Computer Science at UWO
- Learning game development with projects like **[Little Guys](https://github.com/KupaJablek/little_guys)**
- Trying my hand at Hackathons with **[Western Developer Society Overhaul 2025](https://github.com/thea-ishida/SmartCart)**
- Running multiple RPG campaigns using **[Pathfinder 2e](https://2e.aonprd.com/)** and the classic **[Dungeons & Dragons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/)**
